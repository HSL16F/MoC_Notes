A language is simply defined as a set of strings
For $\mathcal{L}$ is the set of all languages, it is uncountable as there is a correspondence from $\mathcal{L}$ to $\mathbb{R}$
Σ ∗ = {𝜀, 0,1,00,01,10,11,000, ... } is countable
Some languages are not recognisable as there are more languages than turning machines, there is not a 1-1 correspondence of languages and [[Turning Machines]]
