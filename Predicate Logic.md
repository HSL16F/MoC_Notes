Expression of statements, finitely express infinite statements and transitive verbs with relative pronouns.
Building blocks of predicate logic:
Constants: $c$ for the cart, $d$ for the donkey
Predicates: $P$ for pushing, $H$ for happy, Identity $=$ is special case
Quantifiers: $\forall$ and $\exists$
Variables: x,y,z
Functions $+, \cdot, f$

**Important notes:**
$\forall$ acts as a generalised $\land$
A term represents individual objects, they are **not** formulas
redcross, 1, x, f(x+y) are all terms

 Atomic formulas represent statements about individual objects, for example:
 Flies(x), P(x,c) Gave(tina,x,redcross), 2+2=5, $x\in y$
 
 By convention, predicate has upper case, nothing else does
 "parent(John)" is a term, parent of John
 "Parent(John)" is a formula, represents proposition John is parent

Well-formed formulas: wff are generated by the grammar:
wff → atom  
| ¬wff  
| (wff ∧ wff )  
| (wff ∨ wff )  
| (wff → wff )  
| (wff ↔ wff )  
| ∀var wff  
| ∃var wff

A bound variable can be renamed to anything provided no clash,
$\exists x \forall y (x<y)\equiv \exists x \forall z (x<z)\not\equiv\exists x \forall x (x<x)$
Renaming a FREE variable does alter the meaning of the logic, for example, $P(x)\not\equiv P(y)$

General algorithm to convert English to predicate logic:
1. Identify nouns, verbs, pronouns, adjectives, relative clauses.  
2. Assign:  
	Constant symbols to singular objects (e.g. “Rhonda”).  
	Predicate symbols to verbs and adjectives (e.g. “loves”).  
	Function symbols to relative clauses (e.g. “the parent of”).  
	Variables to indefinite pronouns (e.g. “someone”).  
3. Replicate logical structure of sentence.

Word order matters greatly:
	"There is something which is not P”: ∃y ¬P(y )  
	“There is not something which is P” (“nothing is P”):   ¬∃y P(y )  
	“All S are not P” vs “not all S are P”:   ∀x (S(x) → ¬P(x)) vs ¬∀x (S(x) → P(x))

Quantifier order matters:
$\forall x \exists y L(x,y)$ says “everyone has someone they love”. 
$\exists x \forall y L(x,y)$ says “there is someone who is loved by everyone”
$\exists x \exists y \equiv \exists y \exists x$
$\forall x \forall y \equiv \forall y \forall x$

Much of the English language has implicit quantifiers

## Semantics:
Two classes of functions
Non-logical symbols such as predicate, function and constant symbols
Interpretation function: Maps every non-logical symbol to its interpretive
Constant symbol $\mapsto$ object in $U$
Predicate symbol $\mapsto$ relation on $U$
Function symbol $\mapsto$ Function in $U$ to $U$
$U$ is universe
A model is defined by the universe of discourse $+$ interpretation function
The truth of $P(x)$ depends on $x$, that variable can be assigned
The purpose is to allow for truth formula to be constructed compositionally.

### Rules of quantifiers
$\exists x (\neg F) \equiv \neg \forall x \, F$
$\forall x (\neg F) \equiv \neg \exists x \, F$
$\exists x (F \lor G) \equiv (\exists x \, F) \lor (\exists x \, G)$
$\forall x (F \land G) \equiv (\forall x \, F) \land (\forall x \, G)$
$\exists x (F\rightarrow G)\equiv (\forall x F)\rightarrow (\exists x G)$
$\exists x \, G \equiv G$
$\forall x \, G \equiv G$
$\exists x (F \land G) \equiv (\exists x \, F) \land G$
$\forall x (F \lor G) \equiv (\forall x \, F) \lor G$
$\forall x (F \rightarrow G) \equiv (\exists x \, F) \rightarrow G$
$\forall x (G \rightarrow F) \equiv G \rightarrow (\forall x \, F)$

For $M, v\models F$, $F$ is true in model $M$ under variable assignment $v$, that is F semantically entails G iff every model of F is a model of G, then $F\models G$ and for $F\models G\land G\models F\implies F\equiv G$
A closed formula $F$ is:
- **satisfiable** iff $M \models F$ for some model $M$;
- **valid** iff $M \models F$ for every model $M$;
- **unsatisfiable** iff $M \not\models F$ for every model $M$;
- **non-valid** iff $M \not\models F$ for some model $M$;
- **contingent** iff it is satisfiable but not valid.
As in the propositional case, we have:
- $F$ is valid iff $\neg F$ is unsatisfiable;
- $F$ is non-valid iff $\neg F$ is satisfiable.

## Resolutions:
Working towards bottom $\bot$ or contradiction, oppose to $\top$ or true
A skolem function can be an arbitrary arity, eliminate some existential variables. Goal is to convert variables from predicate logic to [[Clausal Form]]
Note that the conversion via the process of Skolemization does not produce logical equivalent formula. 
In general, letters at start of alphabet are for constants, end of alphabet are for variables.
Substitution of multiple variables an be performed with, for example $\theta=\{x_1\mapsto t_1, x_2\mapsto t_2,...,x_n\mapsto t_n\}$ and formula $E$, $E[\theta]$, replaces all occurrence of $x_i$ with $t_i$, for example $E$ is $P(f(x), g(y,y,b))$, $\theta=\{x\mapsto h(u), y\mapsto a, z\mapsto c\}\implies E[\theta]$ is $P(f(h(u)), g(a, a, b)$
A unifier of two expressions $s$ and $t$ is a substitution of $\theta$ such that $s[\theta]=t[\theta]$, $s$ and $t$ are unifiable iff there exists a unifier for $s$ and $t$, for example, $L(x), L(c)$ unifiable for $L(x)[\theta], L(c)[\theta]$ are $L(c)$ for $\theta=\{x\mapsto c\}$
$L(a)$ and $L(c)$ are not unifiable as they are constants, NOT variables.
If $s$ and $t$ are unifiable, they have a most general unifier. See pg 6 and onwards for examples.
Normal form occurs for every LHS is a different variable and no LHS appears in any RHS.
Allows for forms of automated inference with predicate logic<-**VERY COOL**, pg 15

## Examples:
Tina found Rover and returned him to Anne:  
$\text{Found}(\text{tina}, \text{rover}) \land \text{Gave}(\text{tina}, \text{rover}, \text{anne})$

Tina found a dog and gave it to Anne:  
$\exists x(\text{Dog}(x) \land \text{Found}(\text{tina}, x) \land \text{Gave}(\text{tina}, x, \text{anne}))$

Lea inhabits the house that Jackie built:  
$\exists x(\text{House}(x) \land \text{Inhabits}(\text{lea}, x) \land \text{BuilderOf}(\text{jackie}, x))$

Mothers’ mothers are grandmothers:  
$\forall x \forall y \forall z((\text{Mother}(x, y) \land \text{Mother}(y, z)) \rightarrow \text{Grandmother}(x, z))$


"The square of every integer is nonnegative":  
$\forall x (x \in \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow (x \cdot x \geq 0))$

which means:  
$0 \cdot 0 \geq 0 \land 1 \cdot 1 \geq 0 \land \dots$


Let L(x, y ) stand for “x loves y”.  
L(alex, eva) Alex loves Eva  
∀x L(x, eva) Everyone loves Eva (incl. Eva)  
∀x (¬(x = eva) → L(x, eva)) Eva is loved by everyone else  
∃x (¬(x = alex) ∧ L(x, alex)) Someone other than Alex loves Alex  
∀x∃y L(x, y ) Everybody loves somebody  
∃y ∀x L(x, y ) Someone is loved by everybody  
∃x∀y L(x, y ) Someone loves everybody

#### Models
$\mathbb{Z}$ with $+$ is model of $\forall x \exists y (x+y=1)$
$\mathbb{N}$ with $+$ is not model of $\forall x \exists y (x+y=1)$
