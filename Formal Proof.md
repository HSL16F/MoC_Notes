Various types of formal proofs
#### Direct proof
Direct proof shows truth or falsehood with established axions, facts and lemmas/theorems with no additional assumptions. Proof by induction is a type of direct proof.
#### Proof by induction
Axiom/schema of induction follows a simple process
For property P if the two statements hold, then it will hold for all n
1. P holds for 0
2. P holds for all natural n, if P holds for n, then it holds for n+1
Therefore P holds for all natural n
#### Indirect proofs
Proof that establishes some truth or validity, and show that such proposition is in fact false. Proof by contradiction is common method
#### Proof by contradiction



### Basic examples of proofs
Informally:
P implies Q and P holds, therefore Q holds
Formal:
$P \implies Q, P\vdash Q$
